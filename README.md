# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to do two things: determine how many Pewlett Hackard employees will be eligible and likely to retire over the next few years and to determine which current employees would qualify for a mentorship program to help stabilize and alleviate some of the impact that the coming changes could have on Pewlett Hackard as employees retire, others are promoted and new employees are hired.

## Results
-The analysis shows that out of Pewlett Hackard's approximately 300,000 current employees, more than 72,000 employees (almost 25% of PH's employee base) are at or nearing retirement age and are likely to retire in the very near future. Replacing them properly would require a large push towards hiring and training new employees.

-Of the 72,000 retiring employees, more than 50,000 of those are Senior team members (either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff). PH will be losing a huge amount of experience as these employees transition out of the company.

-The Engineering team (Senior Engineers, Engineers and Assistant Engineers) makes up more than half of the retiring employees. The hiring team may need to have an increased focus on hiring engineering roles for PH.

-There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This number is far below the expected number of retiring employees, and the mentorship program may need to be expanded to meet the hiring demand and provide proper mentoring and training for new employees.

## Summary
In order to meet the hiring demands from the "silver tsunami" retirements, Pewlett Hackard will need to fill approxiamtely 70,000 roles. With only 1549 employees currently eligible for the mentorship program, PH does not have the sufficient experienced employee base to properly mentor and train new hires.

Some possible ways to provide more insight would be to expand the mentorship program and write a query that checks years worked or hire date rather than birth date for experienced employees eligible for the mentorship program. Another would be to examine the ratio of new hires to the number of eligible mentors and see how many new employees each mentor might be responsible for in a given department. If they have too many new employees to mentor, that mentorship and training may not be as effective as it needs to be to set PH up for success in the future.
