# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to do two things: determine how many Pewlett Hackard employees will be eligible and likely to retire over the next few years and to determine which current employees would qualify for a mentorship program to help stabilize and alleviate some of the impact that the coming changes could have on Pewlett Hackard as employees retire, others are promoted and new employees are hired.

## Results
-The analysis shows that out of Pewlett Hackard's approximately 300,000 current employees, more than 72,000 employees (almost 25% of PH's employee base) are at or nearing retirement age and are likely to retire in the very near future. Replacing them properly would require a large push towards hiring and training new employees.
-Of the 72,000 retiring employees, more than 50,000 of those are Senior team members (either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff). PH will be losing a huge amount of experience as these employees transition out of the company.
The Engineering team (Senior Engineers, Engineers and Assistant Engineers) makes up more than half of the retiring employees. The hiring team may need to have an increased focus on hiring engineering roles for PH.
-There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This number is far below the expected number of retiring employees, and the mentorship program may need to be expanded to meet the hiring demand and provide proper mentoring and training for new employees.
